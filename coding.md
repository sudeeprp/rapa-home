# Coding

> Communicate without ambiguity

You remove ambiguity by dealing in specifics.
Grasping and specifying form a learning cycle

The activity of 'coding' achieves unambiguous communication.
People use the word 'coding' to mean 'typing in a computer language'.
They actually mean 'getting a machine to do it'. Machines can't stand ambiguity.

When you specify something - maybe a recipe, a process or a formula - you code.
Someone else, even a person with lower familiarity could repeat it.

When you write software in a computer language,
without specifying a solution - think of it as typing, not coding.
People would find such 'software solutions' hard to understand and expensive to change.
