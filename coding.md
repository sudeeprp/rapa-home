# Coding

> Communicate without ambiguity

When you specify something - a recipe, a behavior, or a formula - you're coding.
Someone else, even a person with lower familiarity could execute it. That makes it 'real'.

Coding is about taking a user's need and specifying it for a machine to execute.
You make the user's need more and more specific, till it ends in usable code.
Then the user will have further needs, of course ðŸ˜Š

## Habits for effective coding

- Habit of **precision**: Recognize and remove ambiguity
- Habit of **modularity**: Specify a consumer's need in parts
- Habit of **humility**: Acknowledge your limits, collaborate, learn
- Habit of **persistence**: Keep refining

## Crafting your habits

You build habits by deliberate practice. Guide your practice with help from humans, automated guardrails, and AI.
Use this [sequence of assignments and reviews](code-craft.md) to build your habits.

## Guardrails

Practical workflows to use as GitHub actions, based on [this literature](code-references.md).
