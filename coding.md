# Coding

> Communicate without ambiguity

The activity of 'coding' achieves unambiguous communication. Working with a 'specification' is a way to translate a wish into reality.

When you specify something - maybe a recipe, a process or a formula - you code.
Someone else, even a person with lower familiarity could repeat it. That makes it 'real'.

Always code with a specification. Without that, you can't say when you're done.
