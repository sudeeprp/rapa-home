# Coding

Grasping and Specifying form a learning cycle

By 'specifying', you communicate without ambiguity.
The activity of 'coding' achieves unambiguous communication.

When you specify something - maybe a recipe, a process or a formula - you code.

When you write in a computer language
without specifying a solution - think of it as typing, not coding.
