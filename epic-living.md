## Narasimha surprise

"Lord Narayana exists in the pillar" - to make Prahlad's words true,
He placed himself in every pillar.
Need to break the pillar to see Him? Go on, break it :)

`अमृत्युः सर्वदृक् सिंहः सन्धाता सन्धिमान् स्थिरः ।`
`अजो दुर्मर्षणः शास्ता विश्रुतात्मा सुरारिहा ।।`

As Narasimha, He exists steadfast in you.
He rules without a beginning or an end. He never ceases to surprise.

## Trivikrama's stamp

This universe forms a minute part of Narayana.
Yet, He asks Bali for His own universe.
Bali recognises Narayana in the huge form of Trivikrama,
loses his ego and offers his own head.
To Narayana, the value of a devotee exceeds the entire Universe. Become that devotee.

## Krishna's universe

He enjoys the company of village folk in the form of a mischievous kid.
Mother Yashoda looks into His mouth to see if He ate mud.
Checkout her awe :)

## Gajendra Moksha

An elephant, stuck in the jaws of a crocodile, calls to Narayana and He arrives.
Call to get free!

## Kanakadasa

Krishna turns to see Kanakadasa when he calls. Narayana expects your call.
Sometimes you need to let it ring!

As Kanaka says:
`ಬಾಗಿಲನು ತೆರೆದು ಸೇವೆಯನ್ನು ಕೊಡೊ ಹರಿಯೇ, ಕೂಗಿದರು ಧ್ವನಿ ಕೆಳಲಿಲ್ಲವೆ`

Come on, open up and give your service. Didn't you hear?
