## Narasimha surprise

"Lord Narayana is in the pillar" - to make Prahlad's words true, He placed himself in every pillar.
Need to break the pillar to see Him? I will break it :)

`अमृत्युः सर्वदृक् सिंहः सन्धाता सन्धिमान् स्थिरः । अजो दुर्मर्षणः शास्ता विश्रुतात्मा सुरारिहा ।।`

As Narasimha, He is steadfast in you. He rules without a beginning or an end; Never ceases to surprise.

## Trivikrama's stamp

This universe is a minute piece of Narayana. Yet, He asks Bali for His own universe.
Bali recognises Narayana in the form of the huge Trivikrama, loses his ego and offers his own head.
A devotee is worth the entire Universe to the Lord. Be that devotee.

## Krishna's universe

He enjoys the company of village folk in the form of a mischievous kid. Mother Yashodha looks into His mouth to see if He ate mud.
Checkout her awe :)

## Gajendra Moksha

An elephant, stuck in the jaws of a crocodile, calls to Narayana and He arrives. Call to get free!

## Kanakadasa

Krishna turns to see Kanakadasa when he calls. Narayana expects your call. Sometimes you need to let it ring!

As Kanaka says:
`ಬಾಗಿಲನು ತೆರೆದು ಸೇವೆಯನ್ನು ಕೊಡೊ ಹರಿಯೇ, ಕೂಗಿದರು ಧ್ವನಿ ಕೆಳಲಿಲ್ಲವೆ `

Come on, open up and let me serve you. I'm calling... Didn't you hear?
