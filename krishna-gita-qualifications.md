# Qualification to worship

[Anyone can qualify to worship Krishna](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/9-30.html).

## Disqualification criteria

As Sanjaya says, [Krishna's Gita is marvelous and stimulating](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/18-74.html). Naturally, you would want to share it with everyone.

However, Krishna mentions a few qualities that disqualify a person from receiving the Gita.
He lists them in [this Shloka](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/18-67.html). Summary-

- It's not for someone who doesn't take the effort to practice.
- It must never be told to someone who isn't devoted to Krishna and doesn't appreciate the carrier of such awareness.
- This isn't for a person who doesn't intend to listen.
- Finally, it's not for the individual who finds fault, whenever someone describes Krishna's virtues and characteristics.

## Next step
