Krishna Himself lists a few qualities that would disqualify a person from the knowledge He gave. They are listed in [this shloka](https://github.com/RaPaLearning/gita-begin/blob/main/gita%2F18-67.md), summarised here-

- It must never be told to someone who isn't devoted to Krishna and doesn't appreciate the carrier of such awareness.
