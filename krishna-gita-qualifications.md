# Qualification to learn

[Anyone can qualify to learn the Gita](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/9-30.html).

## Disqualification criteria

As Sanjaya says, [The Gita is marvelous and stimulating](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/18-74.html). Naturally, you would want to share it with everyone.

However, Krishna mentions a few qualities that disqualify a person from receiving the Gita.
He lists them in [this shloka](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/18-67.html). Summarised here-

- It's not for someone who doesn't take the effort to think.
- It must never be told to someone who isn't devoted to Krishna and doesn't appreciate the carrier of such awareness.
- This isn't for a person who doesn't intend to listen
- Finally, it's not for the individual who finds fault- whenever Krishna's virtues, characteristics, and possessions are described.

## Qualify with distinction

Krishna also says how to make this knowledge special-

- By studying their conversation [18-70](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/18-70.html)
- By listening to it [18-71](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/18-71.html)
- By sharing it with others [18-68](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/18-68.html) and [18-69](https://rapalearning.github.io/gita-begin/gita/18-69.html)
